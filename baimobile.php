            <p>Our product  <b>baiMobile smartcard reader framework </b> adds smartcard
                 based security into mobile applications. baiMobile Smartcard Reader
                  Framework is a Software Development Kit (SDK) to strengthen Android
                   and iOS applications with advanced security features by integrating 
                   smartcard based operations. This enables mobile apps for secure 
                   access of organization resources like network, applications,
                    websites etc. With this framework, it becomes very easy for our 
                    customers to integrate PKCS#11 (certificate, public and private key) 
                    based operations like encryption, decryption of data, document and code
                     signing etc. Our product is FIPS-2 compliant and supports industry 
                     standards like PC/SC, ISO-7816-4, PIV, CAC, PKCS#11 & OpenSSL etc.</p>
